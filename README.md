## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

-   **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **AI Model**: Google Gemini (`gemini-2.5-flash`) via the [`@google/genai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/genai) SDK.
-   **Bundling/Environment**: The app is set up to run in a modern browser environment using ES modules and an `importmap`.

## üîë API Key Setup

This application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. The key is expected to be available in the execution environment as `process.env.API_KEY`. The application code reads this variable directly.

**Note**: You do not need to set this up manually in this specific web-based environment, as it is pre-configured.
